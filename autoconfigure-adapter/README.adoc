= Spring Boot auto-configuration adapter

This Java library adapts JavaConfig based `spring-boot-autoconfigure` to functional
configuration based on functional bean registration.

It provides a collection of `ApplicationContextInitializer` that
leverage Spring Boot auto-configurations to register the same beans but in a functional
way.

Ideally in the future, such public configuration API should be provided by Spring Boot or
generated during Spring Boot build based on `spring-boot-autoconfigure` classes.

The dependency to use is `org.springframework.fu:spring-fu-autoconfigure-adapter`.
