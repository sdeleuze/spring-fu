= Spring Boot auto-configuration adapter

This Java library adapts JavaConfig based `spring-boot-autoconfigure` to functional
configuration based on function bean registration which is known to be faster and
consumes less memory.

It provides a collection of `ApplicationContextInitializer` that
leverage Spring Boot auto-configurations to register the same beans but in a functional
way. For now, it mostly targets the Reactive stack and conditions are not managed yet.

Ideally in the future, such library should be generated during Spring Boot build based
on `spring-boot-autoconfigure` classes.

The dependency to use is `org.springframework.fu:spring-fu-security-adapter`.
