= Spring Security configuration adapter

This Java library adapts JavaConfig from `spring-security` to functional
configuration based on functional bean registration.

It provides a collection of `ApplicationContextInitializer` that
leverage Spring Security configurations to register the same beans but in a functional
way.

The dependency to use is `org.springframework.fu:spring-fu-security-adapter`.
